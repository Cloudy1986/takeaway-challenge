The dish class creates dish objects that have two attributes:

- name which is initialised with a value of an empty string
- price which is initialised with a value of zero

Next step:
- Create a menu class that builds a menu. Something like the following:

menu = {
  "curry" => 8,
  "Cheese burger" => 10,
  "Chicken burger" => 9
  "pizza" => 7,
  "chicken kebab" = 8,
  "chips" => 2,
  "onion rings" => 3
}
